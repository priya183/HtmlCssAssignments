<h1>Advance Java</h1>
<p>Advanced Java is everything that goes beyond Core Java – most importantly the APIs 
defined in Java Enterprise Edition, includes Servlet programming, Web Services, the 
Persistence API, etc. It is a Web & Enterprise application development platform which 
basically follows client & server architecture.</p>

<p>*Advanced Java Tutorial: Need for Advance Java
Below I have listed down few major advantages of Advance Java:</p>

<p>1.Advance Java i.e. JEE (Java Enterprise Edition) gives you the library to understand the 
Client-Server architecture for Web Application Development which Core Java doesn’t 
support.</p>
<p>2.J2EE is platform Independent, Java Centric environment for developing, building & 
deploying Web-based applications online. It also consists of a set of services, APIs, 
and protocols, which provides the functionality that is necessary for developing 
multi-tiered, web-based applications.</p>
<p>3.You will be able to work with Web and Application Servers like Apache Tomcat, Glassfish 
etc and understand the communication over HTTP protocol. But, in Core Java, it is not 
possible.</p>
<p>4.There are a lot of Advance Java frameworks like Spring, JSF, Struts etc. which enable 
you to develop a secure transaction based web apps for the domains like E-Commerce, 
Banking, Legal, Financial, Healthcare, Inventory etc.</p>
<p>5.To work and understand the hot technologies like Hadoop and Cloud services, you should 
be prepared with core and advanced Java concepts.</p>
