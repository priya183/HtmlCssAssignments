Shivaji Bhonsale was born in the Shivneri Fort in Maharashtra on 19 February 1630 to mother Jijabai and father Shahaji Bhonsale. It is said that mother Jijabai prayed to Lord Shiva in Shivneri Fort for a brave son and kept her son name as Shivaji after the Hindu god Shiva.[1]

Shivaji was born at the Shivneri fort near Junnar in Pune district on 19th February 1630. Shivajiâ€™s mother, 
Jijabai was the daughter of Lakhuji Jadhavrao of Sindkhed. His father Shahaji Bhonsale 
was a prominent sardar in the Deccan. He worked under the local Deccan sultanates. 
At the time of Shivaji's birth, most of the territory in Maharashtra was under the 
possession of the Nizamshah of Ahmednagar and the Adilshah of Bijapur who were 
known as the Deccan sultanates. In the coastal belt of Konkan, there were two sea powers
 fighting for control, the Christian Portuguese and the Muslim Siddi. The British and 
 the Dutch who were engaged in expanding their trade also had their factories on the
  coast. The Mughals, since the period of Emperor Akbar wanted to expand their power 
  in the South. The Mughals launched a campaign to conquer the Nizamshahi Kingdom. 
  The Adilshah of Bijapur allied with the Mughals in this campaign. Shahaji Bhonsale 
  tried to rebel, but he could not withstand the combined might of the Mughals and the
   Adilshahi. The Nizamshahi kingdom came to an end in 1636. Thereafter Shahaji became 
   a Sardar of the Adilshah of Bijapur and was posted in Karnataka. The region comprising 
   Pune, Supe, Indapur, and Chakan Parganas located between the Bhima and Nira rivers 
   which were vested in Shahaji as a jagir was continued by the Adilshah. Shahaji was
    also assigned a jagir of Bangalore. Mata Jijabai and Shivaji, stayed for a few years
     with Shahaji at Bangalore until Shivaji was twelve years old. Shahaji entrusted the
      administration of the Lakshmi jagir to Shivaji and Mata Jijabai. Shivaji grew up 
      amidst the hills and valleys of the Pune region under the guidance of his mother
       Jijabai. His mother Jijabai taught Shivaji the stories of the Hindu epics and 
       scriptures such as Mahabharata and also stories of old mighty 
       Hindu kingdoms such as the Vijayanagara. Shivaji was also trained in guerrilla 
       warfare.
